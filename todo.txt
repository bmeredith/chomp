Desired Features Missing:

- add held items to monData (later)
    - static and triggered
- add abilities to monData (later)
    - static and triggered

- make/take model for starting matches (e.g. p1 starts a challenge, p2 can accept)
    - let users specify if they want to be filled against anyone or a specific person

- to think about move implementations:
    - tricky moves to use as examples for edge cases:
        - parting shot
        - destiny bond
        - substitute

Specific TODOs:
- create interface for IEffect, which registers, updates, and removes
- create interface for IEffectQueue which allows us to iterate through all effects and update them
