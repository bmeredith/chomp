- scripts to convert from yaml descriptions of mons into bst spread / move pool
- some way to let p1 and p2 signal their starting pokemon (random?)
- switch is always a free move, so i guess both players need to pick switch as their first move (special sentinel value)
- battle state needs to track situations where only p1 or p2 needs to make a move, but not both
