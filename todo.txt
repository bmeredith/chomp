# TODO

remaining things:
- onchain matchmaking queue (save this for later)
- rate limit team changes to prevent someone from creating a team last minute after p1 reveals their team
    - can do either in validator or team registry

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN BUGGY INTERACTIONS

1) If a move forces a switch and triggers before the other player can make its move
- The Engine handles the case where the stamina is insufficient (it just skips the move)

Ways to mitigate:
- avoid forcing opponent swap outs unless

2) If an effect calls dealDamage() and triggers AfterDamage, it can potentially cause an infinite loop!
(either if it calls dealDamage() on the opposing mon who also has a damaging attack with an AfterDamage trigger)

Ways to mitigate:
- deal damage directly (but skip calling dealDamage) on the Engine
- avoid dealing damage in the afterDamage hook itself, or in ways that are long-lasting

3) Ending a match before any moves are committed is valid (just be aware)

### random thoughts

- to think about move implementations:
    - tricky moves to use as examples for edge cases:
        - parting shot
        - destiny bond
        - substitute
        - volt switch
        - barrier/frost veil

    - categorizing move types
        - normal damaging moves (trade-off between accuracy and damage)
        - normal damaging move + % to inflict additional effect (status, stat boost, stamina, etc.)
        - stat boost (2 stages to any one stat) / (1 stage to two stats)
        - healing (reduced healing over time)
        - environmental (hazards/weather/etc.)
