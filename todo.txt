Desired Features Missing:

- make/take model for starting matches (e.g. p1 starts a challenge, p2 can accept)
    - let users specify if they want to be filled against anyone or a specific person

- items (static and activated effects)

- abilities (static and triggered effects)

- need to handle priority correctly when moves that mess with turn order or recoil cause errors when unexpected

- tricky moves to use as examples for edge cases:
    - parting shot
    - destiny bond
    - substitute

- validateMove needs to see if it's a case where a player MUST switch (e.g. if it's turn ID 0 or the current active mon is knocked out)

- add a flag in MonState for whether or not it's knocked out

- need to handle in game engine the case where a player switches, and another player chooses a move

- need to figure out when to register/register effects, need an IEffects interface
