dev TODO:

NOTE: KNOWN BUGGY INTERACTION
- If a move forces a switch and triggers before the other player can make its move, it might be an invalid move
- The Engine handles the case where the stamina is insufficient (it just skips the move)
- But other weird cases might happen!







DO THIS NEXT:
****************************
- add onSwitchIn hook (only for global effects)
- add onSwitchIn for Abilities (new interface) for mons
****************************














- add ability to write to global kv []
- add on-switch as trigger for effects, dovetail into abilities

Negative Status Effects:

(Auto cure)
- Sleep, cannot take action, 33% chance of cure every turn, max 3 turns
- Fright, takes 1 stamina damage every turn, 33% chance of cure every turn, max 3 turns
- Disabled, cannot switch out, 33% chance of cure every turn, max 3 turns

(No cure)
- Frostbite, takes 1/16 damage every turn, reduces special attack by 50%
- Burn, takes 1/16 damage every turn, reduces attack by 50%
- Poison, takes 1/8 damage every turn
- Shock, reduces speed by 50%, 25% chance cannot move

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- the switch return (each move can at most switch one mon, either the opponent's mon, or the user's mon) will be handled by the engine
- add a new on-switch-in hook to handle both the ability, as well as global effects which run on switch in (specific mon effects can or cannot run on switch in? i guess can have both, no real difference)

- add ability interface (adds on switch in handler--should this just be the case for all events?)]

Feature thinking:

- make/take model for starting matches (e.g. p1 starts a challenge, p2 can accept)
    - let users specify if they want to be filled against anyone or a specific person

- add held items to monData
    - static and triggered

- add abilities to monData
    - static and triggered

- to think about move implementations:
    - tricky moves to use as examples for edge cases:
        - parting shot
        - destiny bond
        - substitute
        - volt switch
        - barrier/frost veil

    - categorizing move types
        - normal damaging moves (trade-off between accuracy and damage)
        - normal damaging move + % to inflict additional effect (status, stat boost, stamina, etc.)
        - stat boost (2 stages to any one stat) / (1 stage to two stats)
        - healing (reduced healing over time)
        - environmental (hazards/weather/etc.)
