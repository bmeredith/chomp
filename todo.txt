Desired Features Missing:

- make/take model for starting matches (e.g. p1 starts a challenge, p2 can accept)
    - let users specify if they want to be filled against anyone or a specific person

- items (static and activated effects)

- abilities (static and triggered effects)

- need to handle priority correctly when moves that mess with turn order or recoil cause errors when unexpected
